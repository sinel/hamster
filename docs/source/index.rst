================================================================================

Casq is an open-source Python toolkit for controlling and analyzing quantum computing processor units based on superconducting qubits.

The goal of Casq is to provide a common interface for different quantum control libraries, such as `Qiskit Dynamics <https://qiskit.org/ecosystem/dynamics/index.html>`_, `QuTiP <https://qutip.org/docs/latest/index.html>`_, and `C3 <https://c3-toolset.readthedocs.io/en/master/index.html>`_, as well as extending their functionality with respect to pulse optimization and related analysis/visualization.
